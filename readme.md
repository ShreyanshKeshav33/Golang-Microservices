so till 9:50, 

to get that in terminal, we use app.go, user_controller.go and main.go of MVC folder,app.goLet's break down the code in each file and then discuss how they work together:

app.go
package app

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/controllers"
)

func StartApp() {
	http.HandleFunc("/users", controllers.GetUser)

	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}


Imports:

Imports necessary packages: net/http for HTTP functionality, and controllers package for the GetUser function.

StartApp Function:

Registers the GetUser function as the handler for the "/users" route.

Starts an HTTP server on port 8080.

Panics and prints an error message if the server fails to start.user_controller.go

user_controller.go
package controllers

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func GetUser(resp http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	userId := req.URL.Query().Get("user_id")
	log.Printf("About to process user_id %v", userId)
}

Package and Function:

Contains a function GetUser in the controllers package.

Takes http.ResponseWriter and http.Request as parameters.

Extracts the "user_id" query parameter from the URL.

Logs a message about processing the user_id.

main.go
package main

import (
	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/app"
)

func main() {
	app.StartApp()
}


Imports:

Imports the app package.

main Function:

Calls the StartApp function from the app package to start the HTTP server.

Execution Flow:

When you run go run main.go, it starts the main function from main.go.

The main function calls app.StartApp().

StartApp in app.go registers the GetUser function from the controllers package as the handler for the "/users" route.

It starts an HTTP server on port 8080.

When a request is made to http://localhost:8080/users, the GetUser function from user_controller.go is executed.

The GetUser function extracts the "user_id" query parameter and logs a message.

Expected Output:

The output will be a running HTTP server. If you access http://localhost:8080/users in a browser or through a tool like curl, the server will log the processing of the "user_id" in the terminal where the server is running.

The log output might look like:

arduinoCopy code
About to process user_id <value>


Replace <value> with the actual "user_id" passed in the URL.

)

func main() {
	// Call the StartApp function from the app package to start the application
	app.StartApp()
}




















Explanation:
1.main.go serves as the entry point and calls StartApp from app.go.

2.app.go starts an HTTP server, registering the GetUser function from users_controllers.go as the handler for the "/users" route.
package app

import (
	"net/http"

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/controllers"
)

func StartApp() {
	// Register the GetUser function as the handler for the "/users" route, controllers.GetUser is handler function

	http.HandleFunc("/users", controllers.GetUser)

	// Start an HTTP server on port 8080
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		// If an error occurs while starting the server, panic and print the error
		
		panic(err)
	}
}

Explanation:

Import Required Packages:

Import the necessary packages, including "net/http" for HTTP functionality and "github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/controllers" for the GetUser function.
StartApp Function:

Define the StartApp function, which will be called to start the application.
Registering the Handler:

Use http.HandleFunc to register the GetUser function from controllers as the handler for the "/users" route.
When a request is made to "/users," the GetUser function in users_controllers.go will be called to handle the request.
Start the HTTP Server:

Use http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) to start an HTTP server on port 8080.
The nil parameter indicates that the default ServeMux should be used, and it will route requests based on the registered handlers.
Handle Server Start Error:

Check if there is an error returned by http.ListenAndServe.
If an error occurs, panic and print the error. This will terminate the program and print the error message.
In summary, StartApp initializes the HTTP server, registers the GetUser function as the handler for the "/users" route, and starts the server. When a request is made to "/users," the GetUser function from users_controllers.go will be invoked to handle the request.



3. users_controllers.go handles HTTP requests, calling the GetUser function from user_service.go to retrieve user details, and returns the response.

users_controllers.go

package controllers

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"
	"strconv" // string conversion to anytype

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/services"
	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/utils"
)

func GetUser(resp http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	// Extract the "user_id" query parameter from the URL
	//The req.URL.Query() returns a url.Values map, and .Get("user_id") retrieves the value associated with the "user_id" key.
	strconv.ParseInt(..., 10, 64): This part of the line is using the strconv package to convert the string value obtained from the query parameter to an integer (int64).
	//10-decimal, 64-int64 integer



	userId, err := strconv.ParseInt(req.URL.Query().Get("user_id"), 10, 64)
	if err != nil {
		// If an error occurs during string to int conversion, return a Bad Request response
		apiErr := &utils.ApplicationError{
			Message:    "user_id must be a number",
			StatusCode: http.StatusBadRequest,
			Code:       "bad request",
		}
		jsonValue, _ := json.Marshal(apiErr)
		resp.WriteHeader(apiErr.StatusCode)
		resp.Write(jsonValue)
		// Return Bad Request to the client
		return
	}

	// Call the GetUser function from the services package to retrieve user details
	user, apiErr := services.GetUser(userId)
	if apiErr != nil {
		// If an error occurs during user retrieval, return a Not Found response
		resp.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
		resp.Write([]byte(apiErr.Message))
		// Handle the error and return to the client
		return
	}

	// Return the user details as JSON to the client
	jsonValue, _ := json.Marshal(user)
	resp.Write(jsonValue)
}
Explanation:
Extracting User ID:

userId, err := strconv.ParseInt(req.URL.Query().Get("user_id"), 10, 64) extracts the "user_id" query parameter from the URL and converts it to an int64.
If there is an error during this conversion, it means the "user_id" is not a valid number, and a Bad Request response is sent back to the client.
Calling GetUser from services:

user, apiErr := services.GetUser(userId) calls the GetUser function from the services package, passing the extracted user ID.
The GetUser function in services interacts with the simulated user data in domain and returns the user details or an error.
Handling Errors:

If there is an error during user retrieval (apiErr != nil), the controller returns a Not Found response with an appropriate error message.
The error message is written to the response body, and the HTTP status code is set to 404 (Not Found).
Returning User Details:

If user retrieval is successful, the user details are marshaled into JSON using json.Marshal(user).
The JSON representation of the user is written to the response body, and the response is sent back to the client.
In summary, users_controllers.go acts as the controller in the MVC pattern. It handles incoming HTTP requests, extracts necessary information (like the user ID), calls the appropriate service (services.GetUser) to perform business logic, and then constructs and sends an HTTP response back to the client, either with the user details or an error message.



4. user_service.go calls the GetUser function from user_dao.go to interact with the simulated user data in domain.

user_service.go:

// Package services provides business logic related to user services.
package services

import "github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/domain"

// GetUser retrieves a user by user ID from the domain package
func GetUser(userId int64) (*domain.User, error) {
	// Call the GetUser function from the domain package to retrieve user details
	return domain.GetUser(userId)
}

user_dao.go:

// Package domain contains data access objects (DAOs) and domain-related logic.
package domain

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/utils"
)

// users is a map to simulate a database of users (for demonstration purposes)
var users = map[int64]*User{
	123: {Id: 1, FirstName: "Shreyansh", LastName: "Keshav", Email: "shreykeshav33@gmail.com"},
}

// GetUser retrieves a user by user ID from the simulated database
func GetUser(userId int64) (*User, *utils.ApplicationError) {
	// Check if the user exists in the map
	if user := users[userId]; user != nil {
		// Return the user and no error
		return user, nil
	}

	// If the user is not found, return a custom application error
	return nil, &utils.ApplicationError{
		Message:    fmt.Sprintf("user %v was not found", userId),
		StatusCode: http.StatusNotFound,
		Code:       "not found",
	}
}


Explanation:

Importing Packages:

user_service.go imports the domain package, which includes the GetUser function.
The GetUser function in user_service.go returns a user by user ID from the domain package.
Calling domain.GetUser:

In user_service.go, the GetUser function is invoked by calling domain.GetUser(userId).
This call is a direct reference to the GetUser function in the domain package, indicating that user_service.go is interacting with the functionality provided by the domain package.
Passing User ID:

The userId parameter is passed to domain.GetUser(userId) to specify the user ID for which user details are to be retrieved.
Return Values:

The GetUser function in user_service.go receives the return values from domain.GetUser(userId).
It returns a *domain.User, which is the user details, and an error, indicating any issues encountered during the retrieval process.
In summary, user_service.go acts as a service layer that calls the GetUser function from the domain package. This interaction allows the service layer to retrieve user data from simulated user data in user_dao.go within the domain package. The separation of concerns facilitates modularity and maintainability in the codebase.










5. user_dao.go contains simulated data and functions to retrieve user details.


user_dao.go

package domain

// Package domain contains data access objects (DAOs) and domain-related logic.
package domain

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/utils"
)

// users is a map to simulate a database of users (for demonstration purposes)
var users = map[int64]*User{
	123: {Id: 1, FirstName: "Shreyansh", LastName: "Keshav", Email: "shreykeshav33@gmail.com"},
}

// GetUser retrieves a user by user ID from the simulated database
func GetUser(userId int64) (*User, *utils.ApplicationError) {
	// Check if the user exists in the map
	if user := users[userId]; user != nil {
		// Return the user and no error
		return user, nil
	}

	// If the user is not found, return a custom application error
	return nil, &utils.ApplicationError{
		Message:    fmt.Sprintf("user %v was not found", userId),
		StatusCode: http.StatusNotFound,
		Code:       "not found",
	}
}

Explanation:

Simulated Database (users):

The users variable is a map that simulates a database of users. In this example, it's a simple in-memory map where user IDs (keys) are associated with corresponding user details (values).
For demonstration purposes, there's a single user with the ID 123 and some associated details.
GetUser Function:

The GetUser function is designed to retrieve a user by user ID from the simulated database.
It takes a userId parameter, and it checks if the user with that ID exists in the users map.
If the user is found, it returns the user details (*User), and no error (*utils.ApplicationError is nil).
If the user is not found, it returns a custom application error (*utils.ApplicationError) indicating that the user was not found. The error includes a descriptive message, an HTTP status code (404 for Not Found), and a custom error code.
Purpose:

The simulated data and functions provide a simple way to demonstrate how a data access object (DAO) might interact with a data source. This is useful for learning and testing purposes.





6. user.go defines the User struct representing user details.


user.go file:

package domain

// Define the User struct with fields representing user details
type User struct {
	Id        uint64
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
	Email     string
}
Explanation:

Package Declaration:

package domain: This line specifies that the code belongs to the domain package.
Struct Definition:

type User struct { ... }: This line defines a new struct named User.
A struct is a composite data type in Go that groups together variables under a single name.
User struct has the following fields:
Id: Represents the unique identifier of the user, of type uint64 (unsigned 64-bit integer).
FirstName: Represents the first name of the user, of type string.
LastName: Represents the last name of the user, of type string.
Email: Represents the email address of the user, of type string.
Summary:

The User struct serves as a data structure to represent and encapsulate information about a user in the application's domain model.
Instances of the User struct can store specific user details, and this struct is utilized throughout the application where user-related data needs to be represented.
For example, when a user is retrieved from the database in user_dao.go, the data is typically returned as an instance of the User struct. Similarly, when responding to an HTTP request in users_controllers.go, the user details are serialized into JSON format, often using the User struct.


7. errors.utils.go defines the ApplicationError struct for handling application-level errors.




Certainly, let's delve into the errors.utils.go file and explain how it defines the ApplicationError struct for handling application-level errors using the given code:

errors.utils.go
go
Copy code
package utils

// Define the ApplicationError struct for representing application-level errors
type ApplicationError struct {
	Message    string `json:"message"`
	StatusCode int    `json:"status_code"`
	Code       string `json:"code"`
}
Explanation:
package utils: Specifies that this file belongs to the utils package.

type ApplicationError struct { ... }: Defines a new struct named ApplicationError. This struct is intended to represent application-level errors and contains the following fields:

Message: A string representing the error message.
StatusCode: An integer representing the HTTP status code associated with the error.
Code: A string representing a unique code for the error.
json:"message", json:"status_code", json:"code": These are struct tags, used to provide metadata to the JSON encoder. They specify the names of the fields when the struct is encoded to JSON.

Usage in users_controllers.go:

if err != nil {
    apiErr := &utils.ApplicationError{
        Message:    "user_id must be a number",
        StatusCode: http.StatusBadRequest,
        Code:       "bad request",
    }
    jsonValue, _ := json.Marshal(apiErr)
    resp.WriteHeader(apiErr.StatusCode)
    resp.Write(jsonValue)
    return
}
In the users_controllers.go file, when an error occurs (in this case, when strconv.ParseInt fails to convert the "user_id" from a string to an integer), an instance of ApplicationError is created with a specific error message, HTTP status code, and error code. This instance is then serialized to JSON using json.Marshal, and the JSON response is sent to the client with the appropriate HTTP status code. This allows the client to understand and handle the error appropriately.

In summary, errors.utils.go defines a reusable struct for representing application-level errors with associated metadata, and this struct is used to create informative error responses in the users_controllers.go file.


This structure follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, where domain represents the data model, services handle business logic, and controllers manage the HTTP request/response flow. The app package orchestrates the application's startup and HTTP server.

section 4: http framework

gin

users_controllers.go

package controllers

import (
	"net/http"
	"strconv" // string conversion

	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/services"
	"github.com/ShreyanshKeshav33/Golang-Microservices/mvc/utils"
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

// GetUser is a handler function for getting user information.
func GetUser(c *gin.Context) {
	c: It represents the Gin context (gin.Context) for the current HTTP request. 
	// Extract user_id parameter from the request URL and convert it to int64
	userId, err := strconv.ParseInt(c.Param("user_id"), 10, 64)
	// log.Printf("About to process user_id %v", userId)

	// Check if there was an error in parsing the user_id
	if err != nil {
		// If there was an error, create an ApplicationError and respond with it
		apiErr := &utils.ApplicationError{
			Message:    "user_id must be a number",
			StatusCode: http.StatusBadRequest,
			Code:       "bad request",
		}
		c.JSON(apiErr.StatusCode, apiErr)
		//apiErr.StatusCode: It specifies the HTTP status code to be included in the response. The StatusCode field is part of the utils.ApplicationError struct (assuming apiErr is an instance of this struct).

		return
	}

	// Call the GetUser function from the services package to retrieve user information
	user, apiErr := services.GetUser(userId)
	if apiErr != nil {
		// If there was an error in the service layer, respond with the error
		c.JSON(apiErr.StatusCode, apiErr)
		// Handle the error and return to the client
		return
	}

	// If everything is successful, respond with the user information
	c.JSON(http.StatusOK, user)
}
Explanation and comments:

The GetUser function is a handler function for processing requests to retrieve user information.

It uses the Gin web framework (imported as github.com/gin-gonic/gin) to handle HTTP requests and responses.

It extracts the user_id parameter from the request URL using c.Param("user_id") and converts it to an int64 using strconv.ParseInt.

If there is an error in parsing the user_id, it creates an ApplicationError and responds with a JSON containing the error details.

If parsing is successful, it calls the services.GetUser function to retrieve user information based on the provided user_id.

If there is an error in the service layer, it responds with a JSON containing the error details.

If the user information retrieval is successful, it responds with a JSON containing the user details and a status code of http.StatusOK.

Logging statements (commented out in this code) can be uncommented and used for debugging or logging purposes.

This code follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where the controller (GetUser function) handles the HTTP request, interacts with the service layer (services.GetUser), and sends back an appropriate response to the client. Error handling is done by creating and returning ApplicationError instances with relevant details.

Section 4:

short explanation before putting every thing together video

Purpose:
The overall purpose is to provide a clean and modular structure for interacting with the GitHub API. The github_provider.go file encapsulates the logic for creating a new repository, including error handling, making it easier to maintain and test. The restclient package provides a reusable function for making HTTP requests.


Explanation:
resclient.go: This file provides a utility function Post for making HTTP POST requests using the http package. It handles the marshaling of the request body to JSON.

github_error.go: Defines structures (GithubErrorResponse and GithubError) representing the error response from the GitHub API.

github_provider.go: This file implements a function CreateRepo that interacts with the GitHub API to create a new repository. It uses the Post function from restclient.go to make HTTP requests. The function handles authentication, sends the request, and processes the response. If successful, it unmarshals the response into a CreateResponse struct.


Interaction:

github_provider.go imports restclient for making HTTP requests and github for error and response structures.
The CreateRepo function uses restclient.Post to send a POST request to GitHub API for repository creation.
The response is processed based on status code. If unsuccessful, an error response is returned. If successful, the response body is unmarshaled into a CreateResponse.
